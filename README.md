# Mutual-Fund-NAV-Prediction-and-Portfolio-Optimization
Mutual Fund NAV Prediction and Portfolio Optimization A deep learning-based framework using LSTM and CNN-LSTM models to predict mutual fund NAVs and optimize portfolio allocation. The project also includes portfolio optimization using Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) and Bayesian Optimization.

## üöÄ Features
- Predicts mutual fund NAVs using Stacked LSTM model.
- Optimizes portfolio using Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) and Bayesian Optimization.
- Robust model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤ Score.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Kaggle for GPU acceleration.
